# herc (Haskell & Elm Rudimentary Chat)

This is a learning project for getting up to speed with Elm frontends and Haskell backends! When fully functional, it will be a realtime chat app. I'm using GraphQL to enjoy type-safety throughout the stack. üëç

## Client

The client is an Elm SPA.

## Server

The server is written in Haskell. I'm using `scotty` for a simple web framework, and `Morpheus` for GraphQL support.

## Installing

Server can be built with the usual `stack build`.
